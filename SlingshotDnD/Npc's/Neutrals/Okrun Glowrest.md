Picture this: an easygoing old leonin barbarian who, in his later years, traded his battle-hardened ways for the rhythmic clang of a blacksmith's forge. His once fearsome hands, now weathered and wise, expertly shape red-hot metal into formidable weapons and intricate armor. With a silvered mane and a laid-back grin, he's transformed from a warrior of the wild into a chill blacksmith, crafting gear that marries strength and style. His forge is a haven of warmth and creativity, where the old warrior finds serenity amidst the fiery dance of metalworking.
