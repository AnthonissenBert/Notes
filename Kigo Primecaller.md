Meet an old leonin barbarian who's decided to kick back and take up carpentry in his golden years. He's seen his fair share of battles, and now his massive, scarred paws that once wielded mighty weapons are all about crafting with wood. With a silver mane that tells stories of his past and a relaxed, contemplative expression, he's shifted from wild warrior to a chilled-out artisan. He's all about making furniture and sculptures that are as cool as a summer breeze, turning his workshop into a chill oasis where he can zen out and enjoy the art of creating.
