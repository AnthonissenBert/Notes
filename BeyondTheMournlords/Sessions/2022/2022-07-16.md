# what happened

Fought [[Carrion crawler]]s

He burrowed away, than came back as a group

Found [[Orgodar]] 

Made it back to the center of the mining camp

The overseer seemed honest as to not controlling the carrion crawlers

[[Tsabagh's grotto]]
- Deepest point they have surveyed
- Passed 8-9 camps

Prepared for the journey ahead

Prayer to [[Agion]]:
```
I pray to you my lord Agion. If you hear this, I hope this prayer finds you. If this is the case. Give me a sign that my prayers are heard. That you light my path in front of me. That my demons are removed from my very soul. That I can find repentance for the sins I have committed in the past. Believing in other gods. It was wrong for me to lead all those people to their deaths. So many lives, lost, forgotten. Families that have lost fathers, mothers left childless. All of that wasted potential, from both the old generation and the new. That I lead to their downfall. I know my way is a long one, with many curves and bends, over hills and mountains and to the fiery depths of the different planes of this universe. I know my road is long. But with your guidance I will overcome the many obstacles life throws at me.
```

dream:
	[[Lazlo]] standing over a white knight

	- [[Lazlo]] in cave, motioning people to a cliffside
	- Spells being muttered
	- People accending a climb
	
	2nd pane
	- White knight with a glaive staring in a pit
	
	3rd pane
	- White knight covered in blood
	- Half of face smeared, hung from carriage from legs
	- Skull visible
	- Still standing
	- Chamber covered in soot
	- Armor is blackened
	
	4rd pane
	- Lazlo kneeling
	- Conjuring something
	- Inside of the mangled body
	- White knight = admonisher
	- Casualty that they somehow raked in to their cause
