**Tactics:** The Umbral Emissary is an eerie and menacing apparition that uses its ethereal nature to its advantage, weaving in and out of the Material and Ethereal Planes to confuse and terrify its opponents.

- **Incorporeal Movement:** The Umbral Emissary moves through walls and obstacles to position itself advantageously.
- **Ethereal Sight:** It switches between planes to gain insights into enemy positions and set up surprise attacks.
- **Shadowy Grasp:** The Umbral Emissary reaches out with its shadowy tendrils to drain the life force of its victims, weakening them with necrotic damage and potential Strength reduction.
- **Ethereal Jaunt:** It uses this ability to escape danger or reposition itself unexpectedly, maintaining an element of unpredictability.

**Roleplay:** The Umbral Emissary is a manifestation of dark and malevolent energy, a spectral entity summoned by the cult to aid in their nefarious plans. Its presence is unsettling, its form flickering between reality and the ethereal realm. The Umbral Emissary acts as an enforcer, striking fear into those who dare oppose the cult's will. It has no emotions or motivations of its own, existing solely to carry out the commands of its masters.
