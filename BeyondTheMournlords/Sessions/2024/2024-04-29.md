```
Dearest Lord Agion, I stand before you. Humbled, Terrified, Not sure what to do with the 2 people in these cells. On the left, a dwarf. On the right, a larger fellow. They ask for mercy but are Acolytes of Asri. I do not know I am capable of giving mercy to the ones who used to flail and torture me, to those that walk my nightmares. I ask for your guidance in the matter. I do not know what to do. They say they lost their ways. That they did not stay true to Asri. I thought that a new path could be proposed. a path of light and righteousnous. I ask for your humbled opinion 
```
i smell something:
- soot, ash, remains of things that burns something foul. [[Vanaroth]] interprets this that these acolytes must rot, burn in the abyss
