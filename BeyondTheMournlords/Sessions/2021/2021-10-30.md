# what happened

Heard some [[kasma]]

Saw a glimpse of the sun

Went south

[[Ameth]] summoned crow and saw through it

Saw a red light

Liquified fleshy humanoid

Brown spot in the water

Found molten locket

Found half of a token

Got out of the mist

Stumbled upon a wounded man who ran in to the mist

Saw the [[Voidmaw]]

Got pissed at [[Volgrim]]

[[Voidmaw]] spit out a corpse

It held the [[Voidmaw]] journal which [[Volgrim]] picked up

Met some "[[Beyonders]]" heavily armored clad knights.

Unearthed an entire cave system

Pushed the demon back

```
We have noticed you will not hesitate to use violence on our precious members. This shit will not fly with the NN. Any other threat made will be met with repercussions. Your mother isn't safe Volgrim, neither is the Tiefling's little startup. Besides, what will the people think of an Acolyte in their midst?   

Our roots run deep, even to the Howling Planes, Uzri "Orankath". Your tribe's camp is one infraction away from being revealed, or should we inform the populace of your countless raids on innocent homes? Many still harbour hate here, all they need is a little spark.   

Watch your fucking back, assholes.
