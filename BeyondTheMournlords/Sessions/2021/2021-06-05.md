Archwizard [[Zorskan]] and [[Yephel]] seperated the [[trudomaris]] to prevent it from falling into demon hands. One half of the [[trudomaris]] is kept within a sealed chest in this repository. The other is in the [[Aulacogen Isles]] where only [[the graced]] may gain entry. [[accersaquanda]] has been put into slumber. It has been days since we heard from them or the remaining [[Aestuoris]]. I fear we may soon meet the same fate as them within these repositories. We hope that we provided the last refugees with enough time to make it to argas. [[Giran]] is a dependable leader and will surely rally those that remain. We pray that their efforts in retaking [[Mar Ceran]] are swift. Rumor has it that the [[everguard]] in the north has fallen. And that the fiends may soon burrow up even here. We will safekeep what we can for as long as we can for as long as we can so that those returning can retrace our steps north and assemble the rest of the [[maritor]]. Aside from [[accersaquanda]] the wavebringer. You will find the [[Topiary Sentinels]] left behind by caretaker [[ksarenna]]. Furthermore there is [[Viridillatro]] the vengeful. [[Relafurego]] the eye of the storm. [[Solery]] and the[[ vermarenam]]. Unfortunately they will not all aid with a mere password. I foresee the others have long been killed or driven mad as the [[alluvions]] continue to ruin the surroundings into the likeness of the abyss. [[Aestuoris]] mages estimate the landscape will see less intense transformation at the dwarven [[Urngor mountainrange]] 400 miles north due to the magic repellant [[starsteel]] within I pray this is true. As time passes more [[alluvions]] will surface wee must counteract before that. I will resume my post near the coast.

[[BeyondTheMournlords/Deities/Agion]] give us strength.
