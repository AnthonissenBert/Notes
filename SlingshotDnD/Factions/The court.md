**Goals and Ambitions:** 
The Court of Shadows is driven by a singular, unholy ambition: to plunge the world into darkness and chaos, paving the way for [[Magnus]] ultimate reign.

The Court is a shadowy and insidious faction, with each member playing a crucial role in the pursuit of their wicked ambitions. Only time will tell if the forces of light can unite to withstand the looming threat they pose.
