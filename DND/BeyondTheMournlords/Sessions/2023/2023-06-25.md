final prayer to [[Ameth]]:
``` Prayer
Dear companion.

Our paths crossed in an unforseen way. But on our adventures together we grew closer. Hell, we became friends. Very good friends. You were the person in our group who held our spirits high, for all of us. And for me personaly, you were the person I looked to in our darkest nights. May you rest calmly. May your further travels take you all around the planes. And even if you don't believe in Him. I wish for him to guide you along your further travels.
```
