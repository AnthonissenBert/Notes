### Special Abilities

**Evasion:** You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell.

**Fast Hands:** You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

**Supreme Sneak:** You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks only if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

**Elusive:** No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated.

**Stroke of Luck (1/Day):** If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

---

### Traits

**Sneak Attack:** An extra 4d6 damage when you have advantage on the attack roll or another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it.

**Cunning Action:** Bonus action to Dash, Disengage, or Hide.

**Evasion:** If you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage, you instead take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.

**Uncanny Dodge:** When an attacker you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.

**Reliable Talent:** Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your Proficiency Bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

**Assassin:** You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. Any hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.

**Alert:** +5 bonus to initiative, you can't be surprised, and creatures don't gain advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of being unseen by you.
