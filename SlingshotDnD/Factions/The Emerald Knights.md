The Iron Tusk Company is a formidable faction of mercenaries that stands apart from the rest due to its unique compositionâ€”every member is a battle-hardened half-orc. Founded by a charismatic half-orc leader named Gragnok Ironfist, the company prides itself on its unmatched strength, unwavering loyalty, and reputation for getting the job done, no matter how dangerous or challenging.

These half-orc mercenaries have forged a tight-knit brotherhood, bound not only by their shared heritage but also by a strict code of honor that governs their actions on and off the battlefield. Their distinctive iron tusks, often adorned with intricate carvings and symbols, serve as both a badge of honor and a testament to their lineage.

The Iron Tusk Company is known for taking on contracts that others might shy away from, from guarding treacherous trade routes to battling ferocious beasts in the wilds. They are a force to be reckoned with, combining the physical prowess of half-orcs with disciplined combat tactics learned from their leader Gragnok, himself a veteran of numerous campaigns.

With a reputation for unwavering loyalty to their clients and a willingness to tackle even the most perilous missions, the Iron Tusk Company is the go-to choice for those in need of fierce, relentless mercenaries who can overcome any challenge on their path.
