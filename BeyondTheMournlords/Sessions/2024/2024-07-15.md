# what happened

back in [[Bastion]] from the [[scalding sea]]

Gave the ship to [[Bastion]]: [[Romek]] is taking care of it

- 1 scrying spellscroll
- 2 locate creature spellscroll
- 1 clairevoyance
upper scrolls are taken with us
in total = 2960 gp = [[Volgrim]] paid

to the [[Silent Swamp]]
aid 4th lvl (+15):
- [[Volgrim]]
- [[Malynn]]
- [[Abill]]
aid 3rd lvl (+10):
- [[Vanaroth]]
- [[Galdan]]

## recall from the abyss
- planes in the abyss can change from what demon is ruling over that plane
- special differences but in practice they won't be big
- example:
	- point a to b travel
		- find the same things around a and b but in between it might change (but not drastically)

all sound is weg
only thing we hear is the bloodcurse
see the [[silt coast]] and the many corpses washing in from the [[squirming sea]]
- all of them are dead
stone towers with windows carved in
- likely hollowed out
tall mangrove trees
- abberition appear and dissapear

## head towards the mangroves in the [[Silent Swamp]]
- large mass of dead leaves and grass
- twice our size
- belonged to something living
- skeletal arms that are dragging this blob of plant waste on our way
	- no eyes
	- 7 - 8 skeletal arms reaching out to us

## in the mangroves of the [[Silent Swamp]]
- more corpses from the trees itself
	- walking behind, a fair looking woman with a woven basket
	- wearing simple robe obscuring their  
	- most likely a hag
	- white eyes becoming bloodshot
	- pale skin
	- mouth move, and fingernail 
	- this is a green hag
		- in this swamp there is no dignity

- fighting the hag
	- trying to shackle her with the iron shackles of binding
	- [[Volgrim]] succesfully pulled the hag out of the burrow
	- [[Abill]] killed it

- right next to the burrow 
	- [[Malynn]] and [[Galdan]] see a small crater in the ground
		- appearently just appeared out of the blue
		- they feel incredibly uneasy
		- they notified us

- investigating the footprint
	- tracks behind it are gone
	- divine sense smells FAUL
	- a few dozens of undead
		- up the trees
		- in the trees
		- just below the surface
	- neutral for the moment
	- [[Galdan]] looks into the Ethereal plane
		- let's not die here

- cloak trailing us / locked in place
	- no invisible creatures inside of them

## [[Volgrim]] will be scrying
- he sits in ritual pose
	- [[Vanaroth]] and [[Abill]] are protecting [[Volgrim]]
	- sees a tower
		- we need to yet find this tower
	- inspecting them
		- in a stone alcove
		- clothing tathered
		- armor scraped
		- brown bandages
		- looks healed though
		- but not a great spot
		- don't know what they are doing there
		- still seem determined
		- looks prepared for the journey ahead
		- have undead as sentinels
- grabs a stone to make a small tower and makes movement up in the air to signal a stone tower and moves us to look around
