Player characters: [[Sudo]], [[Vauralok Vulane]], [[Mardai Sorrow]], [[Spip]].

The party is but one of many that are fleeing north, away from [[The Plague]] that is ravaging the [[The Southern Realms]]. These people have found each other in a common plight and have decided to travel together, after all there is strength in numbers. After having travelled along the path through a forest for several days, the party comes upon a broken and abandoned carriage. The party tries to investigate the carriage, but is cut short by an ambush of [[Burned Man|burned men]] and [[Spawned Critters|teethed critters]]. After having defeated these foes they are beset by a fiery tornado that rips out and consumes the nearby trees to sustain its own existence. Luckily they manage to escape into the forest mostly unscathed before the tornado burns itself out. After returning to the clearing they notice a man spying on them. The party confronts the man and demands information from him. His name is [[Mathias]] and he was exiled from [[Brem]] for searching the flame. [[Mathias]] agrees to escort the party to the crossing and disappears into the forest afterwards. The party enters the village and decides to go to the inn, the laughing pig, where they buy food and drink. They talk to the innkeeper and an old woman who seems to have known [[Mathias]], and on her insistence the party decides to visit the priest of the village who resides in the central chapel.
