in long:
The party is traversing through [[Silverbark forest]] when they hear the distant howl of wolves. As they continue on their journey, the howls grow louder and more frequent, until they eventually come across a clearing. In the center of the clearing, the party sees a pack of six wolves, each with matted grey fur and glowing yellow eyes. 

The wolves circle the party, growling and baring their teeth. The leader of the pack, an abnormally large wolf with multiple scars across its muzzle, steps forward and growls to scare them off.

The party has a few options to handle the situation. They can:

-   try to reason with the wolves and negotiate passage through their territory
-   try to fight the wolves, but it will be a difficult battle as the wolves are in their natural habitat and have the advantage of numbers.
-   try to sneak past the wolves, but it will be difficult as they are on high alert
-   try to use some magic or special abilities they have to scare or pacify the wolves.
