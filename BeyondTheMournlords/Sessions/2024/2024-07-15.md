# what happened

back in [[Bastion]] from the [[scalding sea]]

Gave the ship to [[Bastion]]: [[Romek]] is taking care of it

in [[squirming sea]] you can't cast spells with verbal components, only spell scrolls:
- 1 scrying spellscroll
- 2 locate creature spellscroll
- 1 clairevoyance
upper scrolls are taken with us
in total = 2960 gp = [[Volgrim]] paid

to the [[Silent Swamp]]
aid 4th lvl (+15):
- [[Volgrim]]
- [[Malynn]]
- [[Abill]]
aid 3rd lvl (+10):
- [[Vanaroth]]
- [[Galdan]]

recall from the abyss
- planes in the abyss can change from what demon is ruling over that plane
- special differences but in practice they won't be big
- example:
	- point a to b travel
		- find the same things around a and b but in between it might change (but not drastically)

all sound is weg
only thing we hear is the bloodcurse
see the [[silt coast]] and the many corpses washing in from the [[squirming sea]]
- all of them are dead
