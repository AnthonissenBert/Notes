- [[Volgrim]]
- [[Malynn]]
- [[Abill]]
aid 3rd lvl (+10):
- [[Vanaroth]]

## recall from the abyss
- planes in the abyss can change from what demon is ruling over that plane
- special differences but in practice they won't be big
- example:
	- point a to b travel
		- find the same things around a and b but in between it might change (but not drastically)

all sound is weg
only thing we hear is the bloodcurse
see the [[silt coast]] and the many corpses washing in from the [[squirming sea]]
- all of them are dead
stone towers with windows carved in
- likely hollowed out
tall mangrove trees
- abberition appear and dissapear

## head towards the mangroves in the [[Silent Swamp]]
- large mass of dead leaves and grass
- twice our size
- belonged to something living
- skeletal arms that are dragging this blob of plant waste on our way
	- no eyes
	- 7 - 8 skeletal arms reaching out to us

## in the mangroves of the [[Silent Swamp]]
- more corpses from the trees itself
	- walking behind, a fair looking woman with a woven basket
	- wearing simple robe obscuring their  
	- most likely a hag
	- white eyes becoming bloodshot
	- pale skin
	- mouth move, and fingernail 
	- this is a green hag
		- in this swamp there is no dignity

- fighting the hag
	- trying to shackle her with the iron shackles of binding
	- [[Volgrim]] succesfully pulled the hag out of the burrow
	- [[Abill]] killed it

- right next to the burrow 
	- [[Malynn]] and [[Galdan]] see a small crater in the ground
		- appearently just appeared out of the blue
		- they feel incredibly uneasy
		- they notified us

- investigating the footprint
	- tracks behind it are gone
	- divine sense smells FAUL
	- a few dozens of undead
		- up the trees
		- in the trees
		- just below the surface
	- neutral for the moment
	- [[Galdan]] looks into the Ethereal plane
		- let's not die here

- cloak trailing us / locked in place
	- no invisible creatures inside of them

## [[Volgrim]] will be scrying
- he sits in ritual pose
	- [[Vanaroth]] and [[Abill]] are protecting [[Volgrim]]
	- sees a tower
		- we need to yet find this tower
	- inspecting them
		- in a stone alcove
		- clothing tathered
		- armor scraped
		- brown bandages
		- looks healed though
		- but not a great spot
		- don't know what they are doing there
		- still seem determined
		- looks prepared for the journey ahead
		- have undead as sentinels
- grabs a stone to make a small tower and makes movement up in the air to signal a stone tower and moves us to look around

## [[galdan]] trying to fly above the mangroves
- using echo avatar to go up for 90 ft
- he'll make a perception check
	- no stone towers
	- what you do see
		- either huge / gargantuan winged creature
			- seems to be to be drifting along the current as the same as the reeds
			- it can snatch smaller winged creatures and snap it in 2
			- not sure that it has seen us

## we continue and see a chapel
- no recollection of this structure
- details are lost
- serve simple purpose
- resting place?
	- not demonic
	- worship of elves
- [[Volgrim]] thoughts and prayeres with a gold coin
- skeletal remains, no meat on the bone anymore
	- some belongings
		- leather decayed pouch with coins spilling out
- a single glove on the altar
	- pristine condition
	- elvish runes
	- title: [[tiarultavar]]
		- fingers: enchantments / verbal components to the spell inside the glove
	- [[Galdan]] sees into the veil
		- soul of the gaze is piercing into [[Galdan]]
		- chapel is dedicated to the concept of nature
			- nothing malicious happens but through the veil he notices that vines appear and begin to animate around [[Malynn]] and vanish in an instant
			- skeleton's soul is absent
			- soul is outside the chapel
			- pointing in a direction
			- gathers everyone to follow the direction the skeleton is pointing to
	- [[Malynn]] takes it and put it on
		- enchantment on the glove is active but don't know how to activate it

## fiend ([[Ferrastu]]) is approaching the chapel
- the fiend
	- light green
	- 2 red eyes
	- scraps of armor
- the fiend will investigate the chapel
	- fiend dies because of the ghouls
- vail of translucent viscous material
	- piece of a soul
	- matter of ectoplasm
## navigating from the soul that points inwards that [[Galdan]] sees
- see a gathering of curled up branches to form roofing
- active trail
- skittering into the tall grass
	- there is a small creature with fur
	- wearing clothing

## short rest
- spectral corporeal images on the water towards the cottage where we sleep

## moving out of the cottage
- see elven man form the chapel again
- following [[Abill]] and [[Galdan]]
- carving wayes through mangroves
- mangroves are dimming down
- water has increased
- few stone walls from a previous building
- just a clearing
- behind it you see more mangroves but smaller than the other's you have seen
- see a large tree resembling the one [[Volgrim]] saw through scrying
- spot the stone tower you saw before

## in the clearing
- giant crocodile, no celestials, fiends or undead
- spiritspeaker is close

## near the big tree
- marching order
	2. [[Abill]]
	1. [[Galdan]]
	3. [[Malynn]]
	4. [[Volgrim]]
	5. [[Vanaroth]]
- behind me a gargantuan dragon peers out
	- mangrove trees clear out of the way and a draconic head peers out. This is [[Viridillatro]]
