in long:
2. The players are traveling through the [[Emberwood forest]] and come across the mining town of [[Copperhollow]], which has been recently plagued by strange occurrences in the mines.
3.  Upon arriving in the town, the players discover that many of the miners have gone missing while working in the mines. They also notice that the town is divided into two main factions: the Hunters and the Traders. The Hunters are a group of local residents who make a living by hunting in the surrounding forest, and the Traders are a group of merchants and shopkeepers who rely on the mining industry to make their living.
4.  The players are approached by the town mayor, who pleads with them to investigate the mines and find out what is happening to the miners. He also mentions that the two factions are in a state of tension, as the Hunters blame the Traders for the recent disappearance of game in the forest and the Traders blame the Hunters for the recent problems in the mines.
5.  The players enter the mines and soon discover that they are being plagued by a group of goblins, who have taken over the mines and are using the miners as slaves. But as they explore deeper they find that the goblins are working with a faction of tortles, who have been corrupted by an ancient dark power, and the goblin leader is a half-tortle half goblin.
6.  The players must fight their way through the goblins and the tortles, and confront the goblin leader and the corrupted leader of the tortles.
7.  The players discover that the ancient dark power is a powerful artifact that can control the minds of those who come into contact with it, and that's the reason why the Goblins & Tortles were corrupted and the game in the forest disappeared.
8.  The players must destroy the artifact and free the tortles from its control in order to rescue the miners and restore peace to the town. They also have to negotiate with the two factions and help them find a way to coexist.
9.  After defeating the goblins and the tortles, the players are hailed as heroes by the town and are rewarded with treasure and other rewards for their bravery. The Hunters and Traders also agree to form a council, to help govern Copperhollow and find a way to work together.**
