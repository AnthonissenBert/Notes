- Multiattack. The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
- Bite. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit:_ (2d10 + 10) piercing damage plus (4d6)fire damage.
- Claw. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ (2d6 + 10) slashing damage.
- Tail. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +17 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. _Hit:_ (2d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage.
- Frightful Presence. Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
- Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6). The dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 91 (26d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
