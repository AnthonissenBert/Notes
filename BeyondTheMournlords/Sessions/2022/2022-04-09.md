# recap

Dented steel headed out of bastion following the good boy bloodhound given to them by chapman They went all over [[Bastion]] but eventually turned north to the [[Forest of Logar]]. All was well in the first half until we discovered slimey goop laying on plants and trees as they progressed, weird large horned creatures arose from the ground laughing at us. 

We made quick work of them but were exhausted after the fight. The group decided to continue following pretty boy and found [[Tarja]] sitting against a tree. Whatever came from her mouth was nonsense for us but [[Volgrim]] decided to go along with it, to her cave where we found her medicine.

However, when we exited the cave 5 figures were opposite of us. One with no eyes, a thiefling, one with long legs and arms, one headless and a guy with chains wrapped around his arms. To stall that group [[Ameth]] called out one final time to nature and made all the trees go wild but was quickly dispelled by that group. Moments later, they were trapped in some sort of darkness, whispers all around. Things were looking dark and dim.
