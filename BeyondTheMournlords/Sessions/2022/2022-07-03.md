Prayer to [[Agion]]:
``` Prayer
I pray for me and my party's safety this day and in the upcoming weeks. I thank you to light the path for us more clearly every day. For the upcomingÂ  voyage underground we need you more than ever. Therefor I ask of you to pass your power through me to shine the light for my fellow comrades and traveling company. I see this as the most effective way to let others see your presence and prowess.
