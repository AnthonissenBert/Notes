Zephyr, the malevolent Aarakocra leader of the notorious thieves' guild known as [[The Shadow Collective]] strikes an imposing figure against the backdrop of darkened skies. With his ebony feathers, which seem to absorb the very light around him, he embodies an eerie, otherworldly presence. His sinister yellow eyes gleam with an unsettling intelligence, hinting at the cunning mind behind his malevolent schemes.

In the shadows of moonless nights, Zephyr takes flight, orchestrating heists, extortions, and assassinations with a macabre elegance. His evil influence spreads like a malignant storm, casting a pall of dread over the city, where even the bravest souls whisper his name in hushed, fearful tones.
