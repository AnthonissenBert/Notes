recollection from the book we found
```
Ship crashed, he wondered what the fishpeople were looking for
He didnâ€™t put up a fight
Slimy figure offered a new purpose
He accepted
Underwater
Found the backhalf of his ship, the [[greygull]]
He was allowed one last look
Rederoons
He knows the party stole from him
There is a certain party to thank
Gates under water
They shoved the captain in
2 Statues
	- Big as a mast
	- Crushed underneath the foot of the other
	- Bubble around it
Metal cabinet the captain was unable to open
He shattered barrier on impact
```
