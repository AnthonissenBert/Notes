- being able to operate on our own
- invited by [[cinderfist]] to swear ourselfves in

to the dungeons
- interrogating the captives [[Answald]] and [[Rainma]]
	- acolytes are split into 2 camps
		- 1 working with demons
			- more dangerous
			- banished demon to their master for some sort of boon
			- they serve [[zaargrathaan]] / [[Shiraak]] / [[Bathomet]]
		- 1 part is disbanded
	- plan after capturing bastion
		- go back to the abyss 
		- capturing [[Bastion]] was a diversion
		- find [[bagaal]]
			- he might not be loyal anymore with this betrayal
	-  do you have the intent to contacting other acolytes 
		- ensuring to stay our path, yes. But not to hinder our agreement
		- they would tell where [[Bastion]] is
	-
