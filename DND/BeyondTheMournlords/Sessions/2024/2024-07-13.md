# **Part 1: The Acolyte Interrogation** 
Earlier, we captured two acolytes, [[Reyma]] and [[Answald]], after they seemed to be betrayed by a third called [[Lazlo]]. He had sent the balor we fought First, they wanted to plunge (parts of) the material realm into the abyss to rejoin their lost goddess [[Asri]]. Concretely, they hoped that the immersion of [[Bastion]] into a populated layer would create enough of a distraction that the acolytes can navigate the abyss freely, using the Styx to go where they need to go to free [[Asri]]. According to the two acolytes ([[Answald]] and the dwarf [[Reyma]]), the abyss was an accidental creation of their goddess. They wish to free her to allow her to remake the planes with intent. A few years ago, they were infiltrated by demons walking among them, corrupting them. Now many of them seek personal power and nothing else. This faction now serves the demon lord [[Zalgrathan]], seeking his favour. Others which are important are [[Shirak]] and [[Baphomet]]. The traitors’ goal might be to sacrifice the goddess to [[Zalgrathan]], which would spell the end of the world basically. Under the influence of a zone of truth, they state that we have a common goal in stopping the traitors. They can’t promise not to obey their deity when the time comes, but for now, we need to protect [[Asri]]. To this end, we will swear oaths to each other upon our gods, if we get the council’s blessing that is. [[Pagal]] is a goliath, a druid, a high-ranking acolyte. We’re unsure if he’s still loyal to the acolyte cause. It would be smart to locate him and take him down if he’s traitorous, or to formulate a game plan with him if he’s not. “I swear upon my faith and devotion to the Ragged King that…”
# **Part 2: The Council** 
[[Romek]] suggests that we elect a council instead of a headmaster. Since people in power tend to get assassinated in [[Bastion]], he thinks we might do better to elect the dead: Mountain folk spiritspeakers might let us call [[Bastion]]’s previous headmasters from beyond the grave. They would be immune to assassination and maybe earthly desires/conflicts of interest as well. [[Volgrim]]’s idea: let every beyonder group put one of their own forward as a council member. No more beyonder groups can be created without the permission of the council. To call a meeting, a certain portion of the council’s members must be present (or, like, use sending). The idea currently is to have a living council with a dead advisory body of the six headmasters. As[[Dented steel]], we’ll need to elect someone as well. Within the former merchant’s hall, [[Galdan]], [[Volgrim]] and [[Vanaroth]] swore their Lance oaths in view of the gods. "The Abyss convenes, and I stare in its depths. I am the spear against the hordes. I am the spite of demons. I am the light upon the dark shroud of this realm. My charge will not end until my death. I shall back no rulers and raise no banners, for my glory belongs to the righteous gods. I am the shield that guards the material plane, the walls of its peoples. I pledge my life and honor to the Beyonder's Guild and my brothers in arms. This is my charge. From this day, until our last spear is broken."

# **Argas Update** 
[[Darano]] is at peace for now, the mountain goliath tribes are roaming without a home, and THE ABYSS HAS REACHED THE NORTHERN SHORES!!! For now, some lesser demons are washing up but no major violence has occurred. (edited)
# **Reviving the Dead** 
With the couple diamonds that were already available, our clerics revived some beyonders. But the Swallowed Void seems to have had an effect: those that come back feel like they have lost something. They’re not sure what, be it a memory, a passion, a belief… Something about themselves.

# **Todo list**
- bring spiritspeakers into the fold and form the council.
- kidnap a demon for Ahrenlyc
- traverse the Silent Swamp and find an exit.
- find the Helm of Fiendish Command
