# what happened

back outside [[Bastion]] where the sewers are

[[Volgrim]] has a vision
- saw clergy with a holy symbol of a spear
	- worshippers of [[skarik]]
	- it is the first step of a deity to lead the person on the path to good and better understanding

now 3 moons on the horizon of the world

trying to explain to [[Volgrim]] what happened to us

[[Volgrim]] doesn't have a shadow anymore

the elves keep calling [[navar'thar]] 
- still seem confused
- mentally drained
- the arch druid is best off
	- asks [[Malynn]] if the third moon is the work of demons

entered the gate of the keep at [[Bastion]]

heard the voice of [[Isaias Bostusa]]
- speaking to us through a divination spell
- the beyonders near the [[Forest of Logar]] have succeeded in their defense
- go to the basement in the keep
	- those magical corridors

saw beam of light close to the Keep

in the keep
- perception check revealed beastfolk
	- 
	- almost eradicated
	- vanish in and out of sight
- [[Isaias Bostusa]] was assassinated by the beastfolks

in the keeps basement
- found a tablet to call all different archmages of their respecti ve schools
- summoned [[Ahrenlyc]]

bastion is destined for the Abyss 
- [[Heaving hills]]

see the balor [[Kurguthrus]] in [[Bastion]]s town square
- general [[Borak]]
- general [[Markoras]]

[[Volgrim]] casts devine intervention
- it is a success

[[Ahrenlyc]] is preparing for a spell
