An undead humanoid possessed by the flame of [[Magnus]]. The dead body is reanimated by the flame infusing it with a desperation to regain the life it lost. Usually this is expressed by attacking any living humanoid creature close to them. If an avatar or disciple of [[Magnus]] is in close enough proximity, they may assert limited control over the actions of the burned men. Eventually the flame will consume the host and only ash will remain.
