# general description

Altenmere is a town located in the temperate hills, where the vegetation is lush. Altenmere grew around a water source and a well-traveled road, and is comprised of a melting pot of all different races. They are a patriarchal feudalist autocratic absolute monarchy that worships many deities, none having a clear majority at all.

The nearest landmark is the Carved Oni Heads: Early Dwarven cultures carved these stone markers to ward off demons. They break the tree line and denote a path between two prehistoric dwarf cities each stone just within sight of the other. A population of 7710, the denizens live a modest existence. A midsummer festival is currently taking place.
