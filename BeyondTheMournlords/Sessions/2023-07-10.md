[[Vanaroth]] did not manage to catch the tricksy fey, but he did relay his position to [[Malynn]] telepathically. [[Volgrim]] then managed to trip her up on another rooftop, and apprehend her. We then took her to[[ the Magistrate]].
We didn’t wait for anyone more official to show up before starting our interrogation.
The elf seemed to be fearful, anxious, stuck in recent events or what will soon transpire. [[Malynn]] asked her why she didn’t stop when she asked earlier. At first, [[Pyria]] would not answer any questions, but [[Malynn]] read her mind.
Her thoughts are jumbled and weird, it’s not how the average sapient creature’s mind works. But there is something about an assignment of the Arch-fey of Sloth, now of [[the Winter Court]]. An implication of her death should she not have complied.
[[Pyria]] herself doesn’t know why she had to take [[Ameth]], but it has something to do with ending the suffering of the Feywild’s inhabitants, stopping the fighting. She would have to take [[Ameth]]’s body, possibly found with the help of that [[Imolith]] - [[the Winter Court]] does employ demons from time to time – to a hag called [[Feludriah]]. There, she would perform a ritual using the body that she had tried but failed before, back when [[Ameth]] was spirited to the Feywild. To stop her, we’d have to find a way into her lair in the [[Feymire]].

During the interrogation, [[Galdan]] step forward and present my blade to the fey elf. I ask her if she recognises the runes etched into it, or if she can read them. With this request, her mind overflows with new information, which Malynn picks up on.
She thinks about ancient history, about the fact that elves on both planes had been one people in the Feywild, before one departed to the material plane due to some unspoken disagreement that seems as common knowledge to her, so Malynn can’t pick up on it. The migratory elves managed to ingratiate themselves with material life eventually, but out of spite the fey broke this trust through misinformation and assasinations, so relations broke down again. A war between fey and material elves followed. There was also war against humans at this point, and other aboriginal inhabitants of our world. A plan was concocted to rid the planes of fey, and celestials (which gave humans their power through divine magic). Oaths were inscribed upon blades to fight against fey and celestials. My sword in particular allows one to find fey creatures, and gains power for every generation it passes through (so far, at least a dozen elf generations). Elves on the material plane have lost their fey nature, elves in the feywild have not. The blade is like her bane, made specifically to counter her kind.
I would only learn all this later; for now, Malynn kept the thoughts to herself as they weren’t pertinent to the broader interrogation.

Meanwhile, Abbil is getting briefings about the over-city’s situation. He’s talking to a mage. There’s demons to the west, an army of the undead to the northeast. He’s gonna join up with DS. People are suspicious of Volgrim and his link to demons, and there’s also the former acolyte. The former bailiff was close to them but the group is likely to come under more scrutiny now that he’s perished.
Other beyonder groups: the last march, the black sanctus, the white scions

Terence Reeves, a scribe and some other guy (he had a last name) enter the cell we brought Pyria to. Volgrim shares all we have learned (Malynn is more reserved of course). He convinces our superiors to let us lead the investigation. We will be accompanied and supervised by an assistant officer, though. We leave for the merchant’s guild, where city guards are turning the place inside-out.
First, a man - I believe a human - called Abbil Bloodstone, approached us and introduced himself. He was one of the people from Shothmea brought to the surface, then assigned to Dented Steel. An excessively pale figure, making me think he might well have been born underground and not be a criminal. His voice is broken and whispy, making me think something had happened to his throat. Overall, I cannot yet get a firm grasp on the fellow, but I suppose we’ll have plenty of time to exchange our life stories later.
We came upon the assistant officer, Bryt Khaman, in the merchant’s guild. He is a bronze dragonborn with blue-greenish spots, white under his hands. He’s holding a quarterstaff and a book. Middle-aged for a dragonborn. We introduced ourselves and exchanged information.
The guards had found the bodies of those three scribes whose bodies were impersonated by redcaps. They did struggle before being killed and it took more than one blow, then their bodies were studied and hidden. Clear signs pointing to the redcaps doing this.

Volgrim paved the way for me and Malynn to withdraw ourselves by telling Bryt that we had a relationship quarrel. Her and I went to her apartment to discuss what she saw in Pyria’s mind. This is where I learned of the nature of my sword’s runes. To think that it goes back to a forgotten era of war between elves… And so far from its original purpose it has fallen, especially with my own adjustments.
Inspecting Ameth’s notebook, I also noticed that his runes, though similar, were actually different from mine. Inscribing a different enchantment, a different oath even perhaps?

---

After we had left, Volgrim and Bryt discovered a clue: a newly sprouted seed of a Feywild plant, which had apparently hitched a ride on the clothes of one of those redcaps. How this can help us remains to be seen. Abbil took an interest in Volgrim and specifically if he had met many demons of a greater power during his service.

Back in the apartment, me and Malynn talked about our lives and about the elven culture we both missed a great deal of. I didn’t learn too much about her other than that she too had never seen Yngren. While I would have loved to stay and “talk” with her more, there was something that needed doing. I cannot be sure where our investigation will lead us, but given what I’ve learned today about Fate’s Complement, it would be best if I got those runes covered up for now. I was going to see if some blacksmith might still be available at this hour at the barracks, get this adjustment done. Only… On my way there, I saw orange flashes coming from the walls to the northeast, and I chose to investigate. Turns out that undead army out there had advanced, and the things I saw at the bulwark terrified me more than any demon could. The brave souls on night’s duty drove the abomination back, but I don’t think this city will last another week like this.
Immoveable Harfaen, your flock could really use a miracle.
