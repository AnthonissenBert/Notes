- spiritspeaker woke up
- pulls out talisman
- we made sure that she understands us
- she left letters in the dirt
	- `HEADING TO GREEN GRAVES`
	- `ATTACKED BY DRUIDS, SEPERATED FROM [[Hjorg Eptir|HJORG EPTIR]]`
	- we asked if the big tree has anything to do with it
	- `TREE OF SPIRITS?`
	- `WHY SEEK ME`
	- we point at [[Malynn]]
	- [[Malynn]] in the spiritspeaker: [[Bastion]] is in the Abyss
	- `BASTION IN SWAMP?`
	- no, in the [[swallowed void]]
	- `I WILL RETURN SOON`

	- their illusions cannot be known apart
## during the short rest
- spiritspeaker is [[Eirunn]]
- [[Milroyce]] appears out of nowhere
	- seems to be using etherealness from a magic item
## bones shopkeep
- walking through the forest
	- something that digs with a shovel
	- pulling these brown and yellow bones
	- stuffing them in a bag
	- throwing them to a big animated skeletal creature
	- how they know is unsure at the time
	- don't make any hostile engagements looking into the tower
	- taking inventory
	- they're setting up shop
	- sacrificing Ghoulio for 55 bones
	- necromancer seems to be in awe by the spectacle of ghoulio ripping itself apart
	- [[Volgrim]] gives bones and walks away
	- in his shop
		- jar with viscous oil: 10 bones
		- expensive ring with blue jewel
		- necklace 
		- crystal that shimmers with some magic
			- commonly seen when mages call upon the powers of the Feywild
		- living piece of flesh that takes many forms
			- doesn't look harmless
			- but [[Abill]] feel drawn to it
- cult of [[Nerrot]]
- the bones given to the necromancer are feeded to the other large creature and it starts to grow more limps
	- seems to gather information about the bones
	- runes are added to their head
## fog sets in
- making way for the large tree
- massive shape is approaching the tower from the direction we're going towards
- green with a tusk creature
- mammoth with one tusk walking through the mangrove
- riding the mammoth are 2 hooded individuals
	- antlers growing on their head
	- hoods stained with browned blood
	- wielding staffs with runes
	- dangling from the staffs
		- ornate silver key
	- clothes from these individuals are the same make as [[Malynn]]s glove
	- they are not imbued with good
		- evil incarnate
	- glowing green eyes
	- mammoth transforms into another druid
## the druids wait in front of the tower
- [[Abill]] and [[Vanaroth]] do not make the checks and the druids see us
