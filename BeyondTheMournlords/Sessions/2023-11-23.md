# recap

[[Dented steel]] arrived at the third glyph in the sewers. As we heard a growl deep within we got started immediately deciphering this glyph, [[Abill]] in particular. As he concentrated on the rune, the water level began to rise quickly. Soon we were all under water. Except for [[Malynn]], she floated to the top while the rest of us used our last potion of water breathing. 

The battle commenced and we, read [[Galdan]], made quick work of a [[water elemental]] whilst under water. As [[Vanaroth]] got dragged into a corridor by a [[wasdralift]] he, together with [[Volgrim]]
