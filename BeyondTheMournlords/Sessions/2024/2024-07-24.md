# what happened

## running from [[Viridillatro]]
- Windwalked the fuck away from him

## something fell out of the sky
- a threat bigger than a cathedral
- similar to a demon lord
- it is [[Garion]]
- the tower we saw in the scry is the structure [[Garion]] is trying to get to
- [[Viridillatro]] is going after [[Garion]]

## a spirit appears
- alert of its environment
	- stands still amongst decay and death 
	- soul belongs to an incredibly powerfull creaure
	- one of good nature
- [[Volgrim]] will send a message to the spiritseeker
	- Don't be scared, five beyonders are nearing and are going to help you. We just reached the edge of the mangrove and are heading over.
- persuade the spirit
	- spirit can't speak
	- it aids [[Volgrim]] if he succeeds a spellcasting ability check
- soul dissolves and encircles [[Volgrim]]
	- he is under protection from evil and good

## [[Abill]] goes down the grate
- water is infested with wyrmlike leaches
- [[Abill]] hangs on the ledge and grabs gold
	- a glass magical lantern
	- a helmet much like the lantern magical in nature
		- not corroded
	- 15 pieces of platinum
	- 43 pieces of gold
	- soggy and wet robe
		- interesting sutures
		- most likely magical
- catches a glimpse of a monster

## [[Malynn]] sees a slow hunched figure
- they're being caustious
- wearing a well fitted robe with a hood over their head
- facial hair
- old man of some sorts
- not that far away from [[Malynn]]
- he's going with us

## frail old man encounter
