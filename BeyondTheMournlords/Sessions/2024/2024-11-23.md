# what happened

## furthering down the tunnels to [[the raised isles]]
found decaying corpses killed  

trying to check if we are not going in circles

[[Vanaroth]] is pulled towards an ocean?
- not falling down but carried up
- life essence of different adventurers pulling me to their same fate
- after falling down i see a forest of ancient twisting skeletal trees, Fungai thriving in this air, glowing bioluminescence. Thick mist casts otherworldly light. eco system flourishing of death of the others. Macabre symbiosis

a man is running from acidic rain

we are hiding from it

mychonids are flushed away by black water from the river styx (this river guides the abyss)
- even touching the water can take your memories

myconids are waiting for us to accept offer, We accept

umbrella amalgomation, top is bone, handle is rigit and light mushroom stem
