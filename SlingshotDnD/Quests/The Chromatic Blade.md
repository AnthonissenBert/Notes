Known for his exquisite craftsmanship, [Kaelin's]([[Kaelin Stormforged]]) reputation has drawn the attention of several adventuring guilds, all vying for his allegiance. However, [Kaelin]([[Kaelin Stormforged]]) has no desire to be indoctrinated into any guild especially not of the adventuring kind, preferring to create his masterpieces in peace. Unbeknownst to him, rumors of a legendary sword, the "[[Prismblade]]," hidden deep within a perilous dungeon, have begun to circulate.

[[Roderic Toll]], an old friend of [[Kaelin Stormforged|Kaelin's]], believes that the swordsmith's skills should not be wasted on the puny local adventuring guilds. Instead, that [Kaelin]([[Kaelin Stormforged]]) should join [[the Wealth of the Spear]] for a righteous cause. for a glorious cause

[[Roderic Toll]] offers the players a map that leads to the dungeon where the [[Prismblade]] is rumored to be hidden. The party's goal is to retrieve the sword before any local adventuring guild does and deliver it to [Kaelin]([[Kaelin Stormforged]]), allowing you to bribe him into joining [[the Wealth of the Spear]]. Along the way, they'll encounter various challenges and puzzles, all designed to test their wits and abilities.

# The Enchanted Forest

**1. Magical Traps:** Hidden throughout the forest are magical traps designed to challenge the adventurers' problem-solving abilities rather than pose a direct threat. For instance, they might encounter an illusionary bridge that disappears beneath their feet or a doorway that can only be unlocked by answering a riddle posed by a sentient tree guardian.

**2. Whispering Trees:** Among the forest's ancient trees, a few possess sentience and the ability to communicate through whispered secrets. These trees may hold knowledge about the dungeon, [Kaelin]([[Kaelin Stormforged]]), or the [[Prismblade]] but will only share it if the players prove their respect for nature and the forest's mystical harmony.
# The Ancient Dungeon

**1. Weathered Stone Architecture:** The entrance of the dungeon is carved from ancient, weathered stone and adorned with intricate runes and symbols that hint at its magical origins. Inside, they find themselves in a dimly lit corridor with walls of the same aged stone. Flickering torches along the walls provide the only source of illumination, casting eerie shadows.

**2. Guardians of the Past:** The dungeon is guarded by the keepers of the forge that were created centuries ago to protect its secrets. These guardians are formidable adversaries and must be outwitted or defeated to progress deeper into the dungeon. To bypass them, the players may need to decipher ancient inscriptions, offering clues about their weaknesses and the dungeon's history.

**3. Guild Rivalry**: As the players draw closer to the [[Prismblade]], they encounter a rival adventuring guild sent to claim the sword for their own glory. The party must decide whether to engage in a tense negotiation, outwit them, or engage in a thrilling battle. If engaged by the party, the party will completely obliterate the opposition (these are level 3 fighters against the parties level 6)

**4. Puzzle Chambers:** The heart of the dungeon is a series of interconnected chambers filled with intricate puzzles. These puzzles test the players' logic, observation skills, and problem-solving abilities. For example, they might encounter a room with a shifting floor puzzle where they must step on pressure plates in a specific sequence to unlock a door or a room with a mysterious celestial clock that reveals the way forward when deciphered.

**5. Ethereal Guardians:** In the deepest chamber, they encounter ethereal guardians who determine whether the adventurers are worthy of claiming the Unforged Blade. These guardians may challenge the players with moral dilemmas, forcing them to confront their true intentions and the greater purpose of the sword.

**7. Kaelin's Dilemma**: Upon reaching [[Kaelin Stormforged|Kaelin's]] secluded forge, they discover him torn between the desire to stay independent and the potential for his craftsmanship to make a difference in the world. The players must persuade him to make the right choice, emphasizing the sword's importance for justice and righteousness.

The outcome rests in their hands, and the story concludes with their decision shaping the destiny of both the sword and the master swordsmith.
