in long:
The player stumbles upon a merchant in the corner of the merchants hall who is known for his shady and cunning business practices. The merchant approaches the player and offers them a deal: he has come into possession of a valuable item that he needs to sell quickly, but he doesn't want to attract too much attention from the other merchants or the local authorities. He offers to sell the item to the player at a discounted price, but only if they can help him move it out of the city discreetly.

The player must then find a way to smuggle the item out of the city without getting caught. They may need to bribe guards or sneak past checkpoints, or they may need to forge documents or disguise themselves. Once the item is safely out of the city, the player can return to the merchant and collect their payment, which will be a good sum of gold or even a valuable item.
