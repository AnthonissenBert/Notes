# what happened

## furthering down the tunnels to [[the raised isles]]
found decaying corpses killed  

trying to check if we are not going in circles

[[Vanaroth]] is pulled towards an ocean?
- not falling down but carried up
- life essence of different adventurers pulling me to their same fate
- after falling down i see a forest of ancient twisting skeletal trees, Fungai thriving in this air, glowing bioluminescence. Thick mist casts otherworldly light. eco sys
