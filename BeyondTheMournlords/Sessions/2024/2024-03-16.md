different creatures showed up: mouthers

suns begin to shift  and align

for the briefest moment the sunlight dims

begins to bend
- 1st moon hit
- 2nd moon hit
- 3rd moon hit
other arm attached to the dial also erupts a beam of light
- begins to pull the creature through the magic circle
- gentle eyes that begin to beg
- human mouths that proceed to beg humanly

rift being formed / hole in reality

eldritch being is pulled into it and disintegrated fully


[[Vanaroth]] remembered: [[Tarja]] membering about 3 moons and something that must be connect, something that was isolated. The mutters that she was experiencing was a recollection of the event that we just witnessed. Perhaps it is not the first time that had happend or a vision of the future. 

a reliqurie
- encased in silver
- with 3 overlapping circles
	- aligned in a way of the moons we just witnessed

as [[Vanaroth]] drifts in blinding blindness
- realm i just come from has no gods. but the symbol radiates hope
- provides me with a path 
	- feignt moonlit silver = ...
	- fading gold = asri
	- dark path = asri
wakes up in [[Bastion]]
- not close to anywhere I was
- I see the druids
- I see no burning buildings
I am filled with hope

we see [[Volgrim]] again
- he looks older and mentally more drained
- has one wish spell
	- He wishes for bastion and it's inhabitants to be strong enough to wither whatever this annellation is 
		- we gained a legendary resistence
		- every damage roll you make against an enemy of [[Bastion]] increases with 1d8
		- a potent spell
