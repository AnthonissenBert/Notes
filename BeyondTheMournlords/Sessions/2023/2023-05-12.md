brought [[Volgrim]]'s mother to the medical ward. [[Ameth]] needed to go as well since he got inflicted with some sort of disease.

---

we went from [[Volgrim]]'s mother house to [[Malynn]] house. Paraded through main street to the tavern. From the tavern we went to [[Vichay]]'s shop to end up at the medical bay of the main keep

---

ameth healed a group around a man with no hand. We met [[Drestan]], a partisan beyonder who  went out of [[Bastion]] to hunt some hesro. [[Malynn]] played a happy go round tune to liven up the med bay. For some of them it helped. for others not. either way. [[Ameth]] and [[Malynn]] got a token for good luck into battle. a token of a ring of some sorts

---

[[Ameth]] wanted to stay behind in the medical bay of [[Bastion]] healing the people around him and to seek help himself. 

--- 

The rest of the party went to a representative of [[Torrig]] to report about [[Dented Steel]] inquiries and quests.

--- 

new quest. find out information about the different [[Baylor]] and set them up against themself

--- 

went and bought all the identify scrolls

--- 

Removed curse on the moon sickle and an [[Nabasu]] appeared and it tried to flee immediatly after removing the curse

---

killed the [[Nabasu]]

---

had a karfuffle with the [[Bastion]] guards. [[Malynn]] gave them a fake name (Allora) and they went on their way

---

[[Vanaroth]] and [[Volgrim]] went to the blacksmith to give the  [[adamantine]] ore to. Sadly he can't make no armor and only simple weapons but to the blacksmith that seems like a waste of time. 

--- 

we went to sleep and [[Vanaroth]] got a dream. a vivid dream. It didn't take long to determine that he is on a battlefield and a shadowy figure. He heard a voice. [[Lazlo]]  He didn't get a long rest and he took the prestine damage of 10 psycic.

---

When [[Vanaroth]] was trying to catch up on sleep the rest of the party went to check up on [[Volgrim]]'s mother. She is no longer sane, on this planet. She has her moments but she is beyond traumatized. Or an abberation is posessing her. Nobody really knows

---

The party went to [[Torrig]]'s personal chambers. [[Dented Steel]] busted in his door and found [[Torrig]] bleeding out at the end of his bed. He had a fiendish wound. He tried to warn [[Dented Steel]] but it was too late. A rattle was heard from out of a glistening magical pendant. [[Volgrim]] tried to shatter it but it was too late. `We meet again`,  was spoken in infernal to [[Ameth]].
