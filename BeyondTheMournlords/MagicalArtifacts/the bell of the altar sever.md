This golden bell never rings by itself, and needs to be shaken to produce any noise. When rung, you feel a presence, completely at your disposal

The Bell has 10 charges. It regains id6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. You can ring the bell as an action, casting unseen servant. Casting this spell consumes one of the bell's charges. Alternatively, you can cast Summon Celestial with 5 charges
