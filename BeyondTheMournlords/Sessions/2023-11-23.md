# recap

[[Dented steel]] arrived at the third glyph in the sewers. As we heard a growl deep within we got started immediately deciphering this glyph, [[Abill]] in particular. As he concentrated on the rune, the water level began to rise quickly. Soon we were all under water. Except for [[Malynn]], she floated to the top while the rest of us used our last potion of water breathing. 

The battle commenced and we, read [[Galdan]], made quick work of a [[water elemental]] whilst under water. As [[Vanaroth]] got dragged into a corridor by a [[wasdralift]] he, together with [[Volgrim]] also made quick work of the foe. All the while [[Abill]] was still concentrating on  deciphering the glyph and without further commotion, he succeeded in his task.

After [[Dented steel]] took a rest at the recent battlefield they exited the sewers, or so they thought. They encountered [[Luca]]. An ally for now but however strange in nature. It seems she knows [[Malynn]] but she herself doesn't really know because of a memory wipe by the [[Noxia Nidore]]. 

As we exited we encountered a strange mist. Most likely an [[alluvions|alluvion]], As of the moment we thought of this we contacted [[Isaias Bostusa]] and [[Ayaska]] to get the word out. To [[Isaias Bostusa]] she sent: "The fires were a ploy to conceal fog getting closer to Bastion: Alluvion is the cause. Should get rid of this. Greetings, Dented Steel." and to [[Ayaska]]: "Thanks for the help. The fires were a ploy to conceal fog getting closer to Bastion: Alluvion is the cause. Should get rid of this."

As [[Vanaroth]] sent out his Devine sense he noticed something to the east, a necrotic presence. But however, the same kind of presence up in the sky. Something is up there, something more sinister. Beyond the sky is lurking something, something, or someone with a gaze locked upon us, upon [[Volgrim]]. The gaze locked upon the used by him objects of occult significance.
