- the [[Baylor]] and it's generals are still there

battle with [[Gorach]] and his generals
- [[Volgrim]] successfully casts hold monster
- one strike was enough to kill a general
- [[Gorach]] reignites
- holy avenger keeps smiting [[Gorach]]
- some demon is targeting [[Volgrim]]
- trying to survive 6 rounds
- [[Vanaroth]] knows that the 4 legged creatures are often employed by powerful demons
	- certain reason for that
- our little dog evolved all the way in a [[horn devil]]
