In Ardentia, a dangerous disease is spreading from the south and causing widespread fear and panic among the people. While the origins of the disease are still unknown, its impact is clear, as it has killed many and left many others debilitated. Governments are struggling to find a cure or containment methods, and the outbreak has significantly affected the economy of the world.

Humans and orcs live among each other, but tension is rising between the orcish tribes. Some orcish leaders are seeking to gain more power and control, which is leading to infighting and conflict. This power struggle is affecting trade routes and making commerce more dangerous, as banditry and piracy become more common. It's also causing some orcs to side with humans to avoid the conflict.

Despite these challenges, the economy is still bustling. Major cities are full of life and activity, and trade routes continue to connect regions. However, the disease is causing shortages of essential goods and many farmers and traders are unable to work, which is driving up prices and causing some people to resort to desperate measures.

Adventurers can play a crucial role in this world, by helping to protect trade routes and deliver goods to affected regions, or by seeking a cure for the disease. They may also be able to help end the power struggle between the orcish tribes, which would create a more stable environment for trade and commerce.

Overall, the world you have created is one of danger, opportunity, and complexity. Adventurers must navigate a world on the brink of chaos, where every decision they make could have far-reaching consequences.
