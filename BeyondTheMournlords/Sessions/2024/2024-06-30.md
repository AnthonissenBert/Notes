``` new oath
"I, Vanaroth, stand vigilant against the forces that would corrupt and destroy the mortal realm. In the presence of the divine and my esteemed comrades, I solemnly swear the Oath of the Watchers. I vow to remain ever watchful, my eyes open to the cunning and subversive threats that seek to infiltrate and corrupt our world. I will be the sentinel, ever alert, guarding against the darkness. I pledge unwavering loyalty to my order, my comrades, and my sacred duty. I will not be swayed by the temptations of fiends or those who consort with them. My faith and dedication shall remain true and unyielding. I promise to be the steadfast shield against the endless terrors that lie beyond our realm. My resolve will be firm, my spirit unbreakable. In the face of fear and despair, I will hold fast and let nothing deter me from my righteous path. By the light of the divine and the strength of my conviction, I bind myself to these tenets. I am a Watcher, a guardian of the mortal realm, and I shall stand as a beacon of hope against the encroaching darkness."
