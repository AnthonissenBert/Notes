The alpha dire wolf are to dire wolves what dire wolves are to regular forest wolves. Measuring nearly 20 feet in length, these colossal lupines are the genuine kings and queens of the forest.

As a “divine figure”, they are looked up to by their smaller kin. Giant wolf packs include dozens of smaller wolves, dire wolves, and even the odd warg or winter wolf. Some werewolf clans even run with giant wolves.

Tribal humanoids also pay their respects to giant wolves through prayer and reverence. Lands guarded by a giant wolf are usually seen as “off-limits” by outsiders.
