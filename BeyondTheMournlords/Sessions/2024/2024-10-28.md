"Thou shalt know me Sïoda (~ shi-eede), disciple of Imorei and artificer for the Obelisks of Order"
> "Dost thou know what awaiteth the world, should it be swallowed whole by the Madness?"  
> "'Twould become a fleeting, fragile and vacuous thing. Bereft of life, naught would be born into it save chaos, great and terrible."  
> "Think well, child of the Long Night, but rest not. Vharneron will know thy decision through the strength of thy soul!"  
> "A pitiable soul, tossed by the whims of ancient sin."  
> "Wilt thou restore our dying Material Plane, or wilt thou die in perpetuity?!"  
> "We know how our story endeth there, hence we relinquish this task upon thee."  
> "These automatons become your charge. Present them relics from before your reckoning."  
> "The suffering thou hast endured to find them will determine the end of thy toil."  
> "In lament, thou shalt cut a swathe through the false lights enshrouding this world!"  
> "To decide upon a victor, choosing the link in the chain that bindeth All"  
> "With this metal servant undone, thou hast understood the realm's true end"  
> "Beware the old sinners, hellions and fiends true, beware the reach of their lordly ambitions"  
> "Evade their grasp and enact thy foreordained role"  
> "Thou wilt oppose Their will, the binated two"  
> "And with our ancient relics Create an Order anew"

I was blessed with a modicum of life to recount the histories of the Vharenorians, my creators, and to warn mortals against the threats from Beyond the realms and inside. I may provide this information in the presence of a Vharenorian mortal that is in possession of one of the following items:

- An egg from Gyndraess' last clutch, ally to the Vharenorians.
- The Holy Symbol of The One God, creator of the Vharenorians.
- The staff of Archmage Imorei, scion of the Great Perdition.
- The Gem Goblet for Theslis, symbol of King Claiborne’s reign.
- The Banner of Dauracos, proof of ancient continental unity.

You possess The Holy Symbol of The One God, creator of the Vharenorians. Do you seek a recountal of the Vharenorian History?

When the mortals created by the One God formulated new power and gained volatile insights of the realms, their alliances split. A war of unbounded magic spread, propagating well beyond the bounds of their targets. Magic was as the air, and those who inhaled it would perish. Survivors fled into the Underdark and remained here for one thousand, three hundred and seventy-six years (1376). A malign force rose from below the Underdark, a Madness no adamantine fort could withstand. They were abominations of a realm far removed from mortal understanding. They are native to this Material Plane, and were here before the One God was. Naturally, their strength was inconceivable. So, the Vharenorians allied with the Primordial force known as Rokumok. They traded secrets and wealth, eventually being granted passage to the Elemental Plane of Earth. Those that disagreed, faced the adversity of the Perdition, expecting to die. To their relief, the passage of time had altered this magic to their benefit. Soon after their arrival on the surface, a Divine being beseeched them to rebuild. Its name was Agion, and the stories of the One God would become lessons of caution. Agion sought to begin the realm anew, and shaped the Dawnriser Vharenorians in his image. It is in this tumultuous period 8 of us were created in the Central Marceran Lands, ensorcelled within stone. I have been awake, for three hundred and forty-six years (346). I do not sense the existence of the Agion that aided in my construction. The Agion exists now only within their worshippers. With their death, this realm will be without anchor. If no deity replaces the Agion, the Far Realm will reach through the Nebula and draw the abominations from the Madness below to the surface, so they may rejoin their kin. This process will annihilate each mortal in this realm within the span of a few thousand years. I detected multiple beings that can replace the Agion, although the Agion may still be reformed by the worshippers that remain. To ascend any such being, they must be summoned to a specific place. I possess only a portion of this location, as do all other Obelisks of Order. I grant you and those in your presence the spell required to find them.

**Sïoda's Prescient Testimony**

> The caster sees the location of another Obelisk or Relic of Order as per the Clairvoyance spell. This spell can be cast once per day. If an Obelisk is sought without description, it will show a random one that has not been activated by the caster.

When the Vharenorians rose from the earth, other Vharenorians abandoned their posts. Only Fort Namuth, Charang, Usmul and Zumanthel remain, but it is likely that in 346 years they have fallen. Make haste.
