_**Turn Undead**_ Each undead that can see or hear the cleric and is within 30 feet must make a wisdom saving throw. If the creatuer fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from the cleric as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of them. It can't take reactions and for its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action
