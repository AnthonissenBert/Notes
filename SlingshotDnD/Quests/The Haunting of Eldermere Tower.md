Introduction: In the land of [[Ardentia]], a tall tower has reemerged from the depths of history, casting a sinister shadow over the nearby village of [[Millhaven]]. Rumors speak of treasures hidden within its haunted halls, and brave adventurers have been drawn to its eerie presence. As the party of five, each of you finds yourselves trotting in the rustic village of [[Millhaven]], where the townsfolk beg for your help in putting an end to the tower's malevolent influence.

Setup:

- The party consists of five 5th-level characters. Ensure a balanced party composition with a mix of classes such as Fighter, Wizard, Rogue, Cleric, and Druid.
- The party arrives at [[Millhaven]], where terrified villagers share stories of strange occurrences since the tower's reappearance.
- The village elder, [[Aeliana]], offers a reward if the party can cleanse the tower and recover an artifact that can save the village from its plight.

Act 1: The Tower's Entrance

- The party approaches the towering, ivy-covered structure. It appears to have five distinct levels, each with a different appearance.
- As they enter, the door slams shut behind them, leaving only one way forward: up the tower.
- At the entrance, the party encounters a ghostly guardian who warns them about the tower's dangers. They must answer a riddle or provide a gift (an item of value) to proceed.

Level 1: The Fungus Infested Chamber

- The first level is shrouded in an eerie mist with eerie glowing mushrooms.
- The players must navigate through a maze of giant mushrooms and face off against Myconids guarding the way.
- They also discover a puzzle involving mushroom spores that must be rearranged to open the path further up.

Level 2: The Haunting Library

- The second level is a grand library filled with floating books, animated quills, and spectral librarians.
- Ghostly apparitions challenge the players to a battle of wits, requiring them to solve riddles, locate hidden tomes, and decipher a cryptic spell to unlock the way up.

Level 3: The Ethereal Gallery

- The third level is an art gallery adorned with paintings that come to life as hostile creatures when disturbed.
- Players must find the correct sequence to pass through the gallery without alerting the animated paintings.
- They can uncover clues about the sequence through journals and letters left behind by the tower's former inhabitants.

Level 4: The Clockwork Laboratory

- The fourth level is a complex clockwork laboratory inhabited by malfunctioning constructs.
- The party must solve a series of mechanical puzzles, navigate a maze of gears and cogs, and disable a central control mechanism to proceed.

Level 5: The Shadowy Sanctum

- The final level is a dark, shadow-infested chamber where an ancient curse is revealed.
- The party confronts a powerful shadow creature that has been haunting the tower.
- To banish the creature, they must use a special artifact hidden within the sanctum.

Conclusion:

- After defeating the shadow creature, the party finds the artifact they sought, a crystal of purification.
- Returning to the village, they use the crystal to cleanse the tower, dispelling its malevolent influence.
- The grateful villagers reward the party with riches, and they are hailed as heroes of Millhaven.
