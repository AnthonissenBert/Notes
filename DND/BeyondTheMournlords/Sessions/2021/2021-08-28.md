[[Volgrim]] summoned something
Fighting a lych

"Rise, victims of the lych monarch"

[[viridillatro]] offers a ride
I try to take the talisman

[[The lych monarch]] is immortal while on this plane

Stil yourself while I speak
He takes over our visions
Strange sequence of images

[[viridillatro]] flying
[[viridillatro]] with dragonriders
Dragonriders fall down a misty pool

[[celestial shard]] chrushed
Mist coating with it
It forms a bubble
The [[celestial shard]] can close the [[alluvions]]

Speak, chosen and graced of [[Agion]]

Sad wail in pain
"Please give me more"

Force starting to incinerate my hand
Crushed the [[celestial shard]]
Energy starts swirling
Pulling feeling towards misty gate
Good guidence
6 to 12 seconds before closing of one of the [[alluvions]]

Above the warzone [[viridillatro]] fighting
