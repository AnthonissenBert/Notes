---

Grizzled and weathered from a lifetime of battle, this old leonin barbarian found solace in the art of carpentry in his later years. His once fearsome claws, now dulled by age, have become deft tools as he crafts intricate wooden masterpieces. Despite his intimidating appearance, he's known for his gentle touch and unwavering patience, creating not only functional pieces but also works of art that reflect the wisdom of a life well-lived. His fur, once a fiery mane, has faded to silver, and his stoic demeanor hides a heart that cherishes the serenity of crafting over the chaos of the battlefield.
