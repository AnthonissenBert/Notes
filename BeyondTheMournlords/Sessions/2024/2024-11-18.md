# what happened

## onwards we go
fiends in the sky try to get out
the last thing I saw was this wandering wooden creature, not pointing in any direction. moving forward
found some spiders, no combat, continuing

crossing the swampy area
choice to cross, go left or right, we chose cross straight ahead
spiders went right
swarm came from [[the raised isles]], most likely demons

## in the tunnels
found a man dressed in yellow cloth stuck inside the wall, named [[Thane]]
