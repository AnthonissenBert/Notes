# who attended

The pillar is not created by magic however it is protected by it

Up above the tower is a slimly frothy trail.

Chain rattle inside, however outside coming in is a rusty chain that grabs alongside the railing

[[Ameth]] going insane

[[Dawnrisers]] are looters

Golems sent down to [[Usmul mines]]

This fort fell to aberrations?

[[Usmal]] = fort
[[Varanor]] = fort
[[Charnak]] = fort
[[Zumanthel]] = fort we're currently in

Forts being sealed and supply tunnels interlink them

Stepped into a trap room

The golem from outside is inside now

Fought 3 golems in the research facility of [[Zumanthel]]
