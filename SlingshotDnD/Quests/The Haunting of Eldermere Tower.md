Introduction: In the land of [[Ardentia]], a tall tower has reemerged from the depths of history, casting a sinister shadow over the nearby village of [[Millhaven]]. Rumors speak of treasures hidden within its haunted halls, and brave adventurers have been drawn to its eerie presence. As the party of five, each of you finds yourselves trotting in the rustic village of [[Millhaven]], where the townsfolk beg for your help in putting an end to the tower's malevolent influence.

Setup:

- The party consists of five 5th-level characters. Ensure a balanced party composition with a mix of classes such as Fighter, Wizard, Rogue, Cleric, and Druid.
- The party arrives at [[Millhaven]], where terrified villagers share stories of strange occurrences since the tower's reappearance.
- The village elder, [[Aeliana]], offers a reward if the party can cleanse the tower and recover an artifact that can save the village from its plight.

# Act 1: The Tower's Entrance

- The party approaches the towering, ivy-covered structure. It appears to have five distinct levels, each with a different appearance.
- As they enter, the door slams shut behind them and a steel gate magically locks, leaving only one way forward: up the tower.
- At the entrance, the party encounters a ghostly guardian who warns them about the tower's dangers. They must answer a riddle or provide a blood sacrifice.
``` Riddle
"My challenge has made men throughout time stumble,
I have defeated kings and left wise men humble,

You see me now, but I am most often heard,
and have killed men when with bullets paired,

You might break a sweat when fighting with me,
but I'll exert no pressure on your body,

a with a direct approach you can never find victory,  
work laterally rather than literally.

What am I?"
```
- If they find the answer pretty quickly they see the room before them and a spiraling staircase leading up. In this room they see living quarters. If they don't check for traps 5 random thing will turn in to a mimic and attack the party

# Level 1: The Fungus Infested Chamber

- The first level is shrouded in an eerie mist with eerie glowing mushrooms.
- The players must navigate through a maze of giant mushrooms and face off against 3 [[Myconid Sovereign]] and 3 [[Myconid adult]]s guarding the way.
- They also discover a puzzle involving mushroom spores that must be rearranged into a pattern of an arrow to open the path further up.

# Level 2: The Haunting Library

1. **The Whispering Tomes:** As the party explores the library, they encounter a series of floating books that seem to be trying to communicate with them. These spectral tomes contain fragments of knowledge about the tower's history and the curse that plagues it. The players must decipher the cryptic messages hidden within the whispers of the books to learn more about their quest.

2. **Elemental Librarians:** Elemental librarians roam the library, seeking to protect its secrets. The librarians manifest as elemental figures with no attire, and they don't take kindly to intruders. The party can choose to avoid them or engage in combat. Defeating the librarians may yield valuable clues or items.
	- [[earth elemental]] or [[air elemental]]

4. **The Riddle of the Lost Tome:** To proceed further into the tower, the party must locate a specific book hidden among the countless volumes. A riddle hints at its location:

    "In realms of knowledge vast and wide, Seek the tome where secrets hide. A shadowed corner, dusty and dim, Where wisdom's light has grown quite dim. In crimson leather, with pages thin, Find the tale where our journey begins."
    
    The book they seek is titled "Chronicles of Eldermere," and finding it will reveal critical information about the tower's history and the curse they must overcome.

4. **The Cryptic Spell:** The way forward is blocked by a magical barrier. In the library's margins, the party finds notes and diagrams left by a former resident who was attempting to decipher the tower's secrets. These clues lead the players to a hidden chamber where they can cast a spell that deals force damage to a certain crystal to dispel the barrier.

**Rewards:**

1. **The Tome of [[Ardentia]]:** Successfully solving the riddle and locating the "Chronicles of [[Ardentia]]" provides valuable insights into the tower's past, including information about the curse and its origins. This knowledge will prove essential in confronting the tower's malevolent force.

2. **Magical Tomes:** In their exploration, the party may discover other enchanted books that grant temporary magical benefits or knowledge applicable to their adventures.

# Level 3: The Ethereal Gallery

As the party ascends to the third level of the tower, they find themselves in a grand hall adorned with magnificent paintings, each depicting scenes of ancient battles, mythical creatures, and lost civilizations. The room is dimly lit by ethereal torches that cast an eerie, shifting light upon the artwork. However, something about these paintings seems unsettling.

1. **Animated Paintings:** Upon entering the gallery, the party notices that some of the paintings come to life as they approach. These animated paintings depict fearsome creatures and warriors, and they attack the party. To proceed through the gallery, the party must find a way to pacify or bypass these aggressive images.

2. **The Silent Symphony:** In the center of the gallery, a large, ornate harp stands on a pedestal. It appears to be the key to unlocking the way forward. To activate the harp, the party must decipher a musical puzzle. A series of notes and symbols are inscribed on the harp's base, and the party must play a specific tune to activate it. They can find clues about the correct melody by observing the paintings and deciphering the hidden musical motifs within them.

3. **The Hidden Secrets:** Scattered throughout the gallery are hidden clues in the form of scrolls, letters, and fragments of a journal written by a former inhabitant of the tower. These documents reveal insights into the tower's curse, the purpose of the gallery, and the artist responsible for the enchanted paintings. Players can piece together this information to understand the gallery's mysteries.

4. **The Mirror Trick:** At one point in the gallery, players encounter a large, ornate mirror with an inscription that reads, "Reflect upon your choices." When a character approaches the mirror, their reflection steps out and comes to life. The reflection engages the character in a philosophical debate or moral dilemma, testing their judgment and decision-making. The party must navigate these challenges to pass through the mirror, which serves as a portal to the next part of the gallery.

**Rewards:**

1. **Artistic Insights:** Successfully navigating the gallery and solving its puzzles grants the party a deeper understanding of the tower's history, the curse's origins, and the artist who created the animated paintings. This knowledge will be invaluable as they confront the tower's malevolent presence.

2. **Musical Knowledge:** Mastering the harp puzzle not only opens the way forward but also grants the party a magical melody that can be used in future encounters or as a tool for solving other puzzles.

3. **Reflection Wisdom:** Engaging with the mirror challenge imparts a valuable lesson or wisdom to each character, providing them with a temporary bonus or insight they can use later in their journey.

# Level 4: The Clockwork Laboratory

Upon ascending to the fourth level of the tower, the party finds themselves in a chamber filled with the intricate machinery of a clockwork laboratory. Cogs, gears, and steam-powered contraptions dominate the space. The room is dimly lit by flickering gas lamps, and the air is heavy with the scent of oil and metal.

**Encounters and Puzzles:**

1. **Malfunctioning Constructs:** The clockwork laboratory is guarded by a series of malfunctioning clockwork constructs, including clockwork spiders, guardians, and golems. These constructs attack intruders on sight, and the party must defeat them or find ways to deactivate them to proceed.
    
2. **The Gear Maze:** The central part of the laboratory is a maze of interlocking gears and rotating platforms. The party must navigate this complex mechanical puzzle, avoiding crushing hazards and traps. They can use their knowledge of machinery or guidance from documents found in the laboratory to solve the maze.
    
3. **The Harmonic Puzzle:** In a corner of the laboratory, the party encounters a massive, intricate contraption of gears and chimes. To proceed further into the tower, they must solve a harmonic puzzle. The party must adjust the gears to create a specific musical sequence by aligning the chimes correctly. Clues for the puzzle can be found in the form of sheet music scattered throughout the laboratory.
    
4. **The Control Mechanism:** At the heart of the laboratory, the party discovers a massive control panel that appears to be responsible for the malfunction of the constructs and the maze's operation. They must decipher a series of levers, buttons, and dials to disable the machinery. This requires careful observation and trial-and-error.
    

**Rewards:**

1. **Clockwork Knowledge:** Successfully navigating the clockwork laboratory grants the party valuable insights into clockwork machinery and constructs, which may prove useful in future encounters or for crafting items.
    
2. **Musical Talents:** Solving the harmonic puzzle not only opens the way forward but also bestows the party with a magical tune that can be used in future encounters or as a means of charming or communicating with clockwork beings.
    
3. **Control Over Machinery:** Disabling the control mechanism grants the party temporary control over some of the clockwork constructs in the laboratory. They can use these constructs as allies or distractions in future battles.
