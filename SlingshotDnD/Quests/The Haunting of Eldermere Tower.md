Introduction: In the land of [[Ardentia]], a tall tower has reemerged from the depths of history, casting a sinister shadow over the nearby village of [[Millhaven]]. Rumors speak of treasures hidden within its haunted halls, and brave adventurers have been drawn to its eerie presence. As the party of five, each of you finds yourselves trotting in the rustic village of [[Millhaven]], where the townsfolk beg for your help in putting an end to the tower's malevolent influence.

Setup:

- The party consists of five 5th-level characters. Ensure a balanced party composition with a mix of classes such as Fighter, Wizard, Rogue, Cleric, and Druid.
- The party arrives at [[Millhaven]], where terrified villagers share stories of strange occurrences since the tower's reappearance.
- The village elder, [[Aeliana]], offers a reward if the party can cleanse the tower and recover an artifact that can save the village from its plight.

# Act 1: The Tower's Entrance

- The party approaches the towering, ivy-covered structure. It appears to have five distinct levels, each with a different appearance.
- As they enter, the door slams shut behind them and a steel gate magically locks, leaving only one way forward: up the tower.
- At the entrance, the party encounters a ghostly guardian who warns them about the tower's dangers. They must answer a riddle or provide a blood sacrifice.
``` Riddle
"My challenge has made men throughout time stumble,
I have defeated kings and left wise men humble,

You see me now, but I am most often heard,
and have killed men when with bullets paired,

You might break a sweat when fighting with me,
but I'll exert no pressure on your body,

a with a direct approach you can never find victory,  
work laterally rather than literally.

What am I?"
```
- If they find the answer pretty quickly they see the room before them and a spiraling staircase leading up. In this room they see living quarters. If they don't check for traps 5 random thing will turn in to a mimic and attack the party

# Level 1: The Fungus Infested Chamber

- The first level is shrouded in an eerie mist with eerie glowing mushrooms.
- The players must navigate through a maze of giant mushrooms and face off against 3 [[Myconid Sovereign]] and 3 [[Myconid adult]]s guarding the way.
- They also discover a puzzle involving mushroom spores that must be rearranged into a pattern of an arrow to open the path further up.

# Level 2: The Haunting Library

1. **The Whispering Tomes:** As the party explores the library, they encounter a series of floating books that seem to be trying to communicate with them. These spectral tomes contain fragments of knowledge about the tower's history and the curse that plagues it. The players must decipher the cryptic messages hidden within the whispers of the books to learn more about their quest.

2. **Elemental Librarians:** Elemental librarians roam the library, seeking to protect its secrets. The librarians manifest as elemental figures with no attire, and they don't take kindly to intruders. The party can choose to avoid them or engage in combat. Defeating the librarians may yield valuable clues or items.
	- [[earth elemental]]
	- [[air elemental]]

4. **The Riddle of the Lost Tome:** To proceed further into the tower, the party must locate a specific book hidden among the countless volumes. A riddle hints at its location:

    "In realms of knowledge vast and wide, Seek the tome where secrets hide. A shadowed corner, dusty and dim, Where wisdom's light has grown quite dim. In crimson leather, with pages thin, Find the tale where our journey begins."
    
    The book they seek is titled "Chronicles of Eldermere," and finding it will reveal critical information about the tower's history and the curse they must overcome.

4. **The Cryptic Spell:** The way forward is blocked by a magical barrier. In the library's margins, the party finds notes and diagrams left by a former resident who was attempting to decipher the tower's secrets. These clues lead the players to a hidden chamber where they can cast a spell to dispel the barrier. The spell requires them to collect specific reagents found throughout the library.

**Rewards:**

1. **The Tome of Eldermere:** Successfully solving the riddle and locating the "Chronicles of Eldermere" provides valuable insights into the tower's past, including information about the curse and its origins. This knowledge will prove essential in confronting the tower's malevolent force.
    
2. **Magical Tomes:** In their exploration, the party may discover other enchanted books that grant temporary magical benefits or knowledge applicable to their adventures.
    
3. **Reagents for the Spell:** Collecting the required reagents allows the party to dispel the magical barrier and continue their ascent through the tower.

# Level 3: The Ethereal Gallery

- The third level is an art gallery adorned with paintings that come to life as hostile creatures when disturbed.
- Players must find the correct sequence to pass through the gallery without alerting the animated paintings.
- They can uncover clues about the sequence through journals and letters left behind by the tower's former inhabitants.

Level 4: The Clockwork Laboratory

- The fourth level is a complex clockwork laboratory inhabited by malfunctioning constructs.
- The party must solve a series of mechanical puzzles, navigate a maze of gears and cogs, and disable a central control mechanism to proceed.

Level 5: The Shadowy Sanctum

- The final level is a dark, shadow-infested chamber where an ancient curse is revealed.
- The party confronts a powerful shadow creature that has been haunting the tower.
- To banish the creature, they must use a special artifact hidden within the sanctum.

Conclusion:

- After defeating the shadow creature, the party finds the artifact they sought, a crystal of purification.
- Returning to the village, they use the crystal to cleanse the tower, dispelling its malevolent influence.
