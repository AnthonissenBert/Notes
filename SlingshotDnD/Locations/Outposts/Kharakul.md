on the  the rugged [[Copper Tops]] mountain range, the dwarven outpost of Kharakul stands as a testament to the resilience and craftsmanship of the dwarves. Carved into the very cloak of the mountains, this outpost serves as both a formidable military stronghold and a welcoming haven for weary travelers and miners. The outpost is constructed primarily of stone and adorned with intricate copper engravings, a tribute to the rich mineral deposits that surround it.
