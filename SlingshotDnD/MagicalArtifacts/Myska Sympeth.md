This is a large electrum bowl, painted gold. The inside of the bowl is worn from use. This artefact is infused with the essence of [[Yuria]] and is used in religious rites related to its worship. [[Yuria]] is able to sense where the bowl is presently whenever it is touched by an intelligent living creature.
