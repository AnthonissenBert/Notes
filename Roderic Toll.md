Roderic is a towering human with a commanding presence. Standing at nearly 6 feet 7 inches tall, his broad shoulders and well-built frame exude strength and confidence. His weathered face carries the marks of a life well-lived, with a strong jawline, a few scars, and deep-set, piercing blue eyes that seem to hold a wealth of wisdom and experience. Roderic's long, salt-and-pepper hair flows down his back, and his neatly groomed beard adds to his imposing yet distinguished appearance. He wears a dark cloak that billows around him, giving him an air of mystery as he moves with purpose and determination.
