The introduction:

Once, there was a benevolent Aasimar that lived in the North of [[Mar Ceran]]. He kept his continent   
safe by enforcing order and light. Being an Aasimar and born of a deity, this was his duty. A duty   
which he abandoned with his sudden departure. The land fell into chaos, strange warped entities   
crawled out of the fogs that spread from his kingdom. No one could stop the advance of the fog and was then referred to as The Beyond. It pushed civilization back to the shores, and eventually onto [[Argas]], which was considered mostly uncharted territory until then. It was quickly colonized by the remaining migrants and life continued.

Several hundred years passed and people had forgotten about The Beyond. Strangely, sea creatures and aquatic wildlife started to become affected as well. Civilization had no where to run, so they decided to throw anything they had at it. It started with small fleets, venturing back whence they came, back to [[Mar Ceran]]. Their efforts took many years, many lives and many coppers, but finally they conquered a piece of land in the far South.   

This settlement is called The Beyonder's [[Bastion]]. The descendants of the great kingdom of [[Mar Ceran]] organized, aiming to reclaim lost lands, rediscover history, enrich themselves and to protect the civilization that still exists. The bravest and purest went to stop this cataclysmic menace. 

You are one of these descendants. Born on [[Argas]] and a stranger to those new lands, you venture   
forth into The Beyond. You may forge alliances or make enemies, loot ruins abandoned for centuries, and with enough preparation face nightmarish entities.

Your adventure begins in [[Barkayal Bay]], still weary from your hike to this harbor your eyes can't help but become fixed upon an arriving Galleon ship. Soon, you will be able to call yourself   
A Beyonder.
