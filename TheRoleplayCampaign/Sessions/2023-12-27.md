# what happened

arrived at alcove ([[Aelwan Cove]])

10/15 corpses laying around

goal: why the mine groups are dissapearing for 150 gold

[[Ithilwen]] questions why we are here

met a dryad named: [[Aelwan]]

river north - northeast to us where a "dragon" lays

[[Garthor]] knows about a dragon
- attracted to
	- magic holding stone
	- sapphires
	- gold
- problem for [[Darmor]]

dryad tasked with keeping the cove safe
- dwarves are not to enter
	- even build an outpost
- any person who's greed is greater than their intelligence

[[Ithilwen]] has a dark mark tattoo
- if she talks about the [[Aelwan Cove]] [[Aelwan]] will know about this
- connection to [[Tana]] if you need it

[[Etlir]] wants to test the magical properties of [[summerstone]]
- [[Garthor]] distracts the dryad
- [[Elowyn]] tried to steal a piece of [[summerstone]]
	- out of the hand of the dead goblin there grows a bloodmoon flower

[[summerstone]] enhances magical abilities
