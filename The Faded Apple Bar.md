Type: Tavern
Location: [[Millhaven]]

---

A wooden building with a limestone roof, the Faded Apple Bar stands one story tall. This place has never had a high number of patrons, because of an incident that recently occured. Inside, the tavern's spacious common room was dominated by a great fighting pit set 20 ft. deep within it's floor, known to everyone as 'The Pit'.

As you approach, you notice the tavern has a light atmosphere. The mead is flowing, and everyone seems to be in a great mood.
