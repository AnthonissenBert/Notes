Player characters: [[Sudo]], [[Vauralok Vulane]], [[Mardai Sorrow]], [[Spip]], [[Fluffy]], [[Duts]]

The guard outside the chapel have drawn their weapons and have started hacking at the door to break it down. Meanwhile on the other side [[Fluffy]] and [[Sudo]] decide to take the wooden benches from inside the chapel and stack them in front of the door to serve as a barricade. [[Vauralok Vulane|Vauralok]] narrowly manages to avoid the burst of flame that erupts from the now opened hatch, which reveals a stone staircase leading down to a cellar. [[Mardai Sorrow|Marco]], [[Vauralok Vulane|Vauralok]] and [[Spip]] go down and discover a small chamber lined with shelves containing books and foodstuffs. There is also an old hearth that lies dormant but reveals a long narrow tunnel leading into the darkness. [[Spip]] decides to dash off into the unknown, while the others warn [[Sudo]] and [[Fluffy]] that they are escaping through the cellar. They decide to put their makeshift barricade to the flame, but as they are trying to leave a blinding light emanates from the back of the chapel. A [[Duts|young female elf]] is seen descending, cloaked in the banner of [[Yuria]] that was hanging behind the chapels altar. The unknown figure offers her aid in helping the party defeat [[Father Petroika]], which they accept. The party travels through the tunnel and emerges somewhere in the woods where they start searching for [[Spip]] and [[Father Petroika]]; Eventually they find the goblin trying to get to the [[Myska Sympeth|golden bowl]], which has been placed in the middle of a clearing and has a fire burning within. [[Father Petroika]] sneaks up behind [[Spip]] and tries to grab her, but she manages to escape and as [[Burned Man|burned men]] emerge from the forest combat ensues. [[Father Petroika]] reveals himself to have flame based magics and together with the [[Burned Man|burned men]] attacks the party. During the battle, the flame grows and eventually consumes enough essence from its surrounding to produce a [[Fire elemental]]. The party manages to down the priest but he is resurrected by the flame unleashing devastating magics on the them. In the end the party narrowly defeats their enemies with the help of the healing magics of the [[Duts|elf]]. She reveals herself to be [[Yuria]], possessing the body of another to aid the party directly. After some final words, the possession is ended and [[Duts]] regains her senses to find a party of strangers departing for [[Brem|the nearby village]].
