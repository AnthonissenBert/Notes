Player characters: [[Sudo]], [[Vauralok Vulane]], [[Mardai Sorrow]], [[Spip]], [[Fluffy]]

[[Fluffy]], having fled from [[The Plague]] and ending up lost in the woods, has found shelter with [[Father Petroika]] of [[Brem]]. The rest of the party shows up at the door of the chapel and is allowed entry by the priest. In exchange for food and shelter, the party agrees to help [[Father Petroika]] find what he calls a serpent that is subverting the good people of [[Brem]], making them turn on their fellow man and their goddess [[Yuria]]. [[Father Petroika]] explains that the people follow a religious doctrine centered around compassion and generosity and that the serpent makes the people turn away, sometimes leading to banishment from the community. After a "good" night's sleep in the chapel, the party having been joined by [[Fluffy]] witnesses the daily mass, where everyone from the village attends and offers fetishes and other keepsakes to the flame being held in a [[Myska Sympeth|golden bowl]]. There they notice [[Smirma|a woman]] that is acting different from the rest of the townsfolk. After a brief kidnapping, [[Mardai Sorrow|Marco]] and [[Vauralok Vulane|Vauralok]] interrogate her while [[Sudo]] and [[Fluffy]] debate whether or not she is the serpent and should be executed accordingly. In the end the party is persuaded by [[Smirma]] that [[Father Petroika]] is actually the one sowing dissent in the community and that she shall help them defeat him. The party marches back to the chapel, only to find [[Father Petroika]] missing, so [[Mardai Sorrow|Marco]] and [[Vauralok Vulane|Vauralok]] decide to investigate the private chambers. Meanwhile the village guards have grown suspicious of the parties actions and are marching on the doors of the chapel, which [[Sudo]] and [[Fluffy]] are holding shut. The investigation turns up a [[Everburning Coal|small burning coal]] and a metal key with a ball shaped tip. They also discover a closed metal hatch under a rug, which [[Vauralok Vulane|Vauralok]] just manages to pick open as the guards outside decide to start breaking open the chapel doors.
